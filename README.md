- **Claim:** There should be 10 AHU units in total, with 1 unit on each level. The group checks how many AHU's there are in the model.
- **Report Reference:** Claim stated on page 8 of the report "CES_BLD_24_0_6_MEP."

### 3.2 Group 15 - Claim

- **Claim:** There should be 1509 windows in the architectural model.

### 4. Our Role as Managers

- **Script or Plan**: Our script is importing Ifcopenshell and running both the Architectural model and the MEP model. We use "#" to toggle each path on or off. We run the results of their scripts so we aren't running the rules, but the part of the main script that counts number of AHU's and number of windows. After the script it is seen that there are 2 AHU's in the MEP model and 1509 windows in the architectural model.
