  As we have chosen to move from managers to develop an independent tool we have made the A2-assignment for our project and uploaded it as "Supplementary A2.dm" in this repository. Also, the BPMN diagram is uploaded as a .svg file in this repository. Furthermore, the whole script can be seen in main.py in this repository and runs without other scripts as long as directories are defined correctly.
