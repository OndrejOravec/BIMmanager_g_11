  <summary>A2b. Identify claim</summary>

  ### Group 14 - Claim
  - **Claim:** 
  - **Report Reference:** "CES_BLD_24_0_6_MEP" (p. 8)
  - **Description of claim we wish to check**
  - **Justification of selection of our claim**

  ### Group 15 - Claim
  - **Claim:** We wil try to find U-Value. The U-Value of a material or structure significantly impacts the amount of
  daylight allowed through a building envelope,affecting thermal performance and energy efficiency
  - **Report Reference:** We can find this in the "CES_BLD_24_0_6_MEP" (page 15)
  - **Description of claim we wish to check** We are investigating whether the reported U-Value for certain materials (likely glass or windows)
  optimally balances thermal insulation and daylight penetration, improving energy efficiency and occupant comfort.
  - **Justification of selection of our claim** This claim is crucial as it touches on both energy efficiency and building comfort.
  The U-Value is a measure of heat loss, and ensuring proper daylight entry without compromising
  insulation is key to designing sustainable and energy-efficient buildings.

  <summary>A2c. Use Case</summary>

  ### Group 14 - Claim
  - **How and when we check this claim?** 
  - **What information does this claim rely on?** #maybe just use reference on file and page as in previous chapter
  - **What BIM purpose is required?**
  - **BPMN drawing:** 

  ### Group 15 - Claim
  - **How and when we check this claim?** We will check the claim by creating a Python script within Blender to analyze the U-Value's impact on daylight performance in our building
  - **What information does this claim rely on?** Material properties, particularly the U-Value of windows or glazing systems (thermal transmittance).
  Daylight transmittance data, Visible Light Transmittance or Solar Heat Gain Coefficient.
  standards and codes which is cited in the report ("CES_BLD_24_0_6_MEP" (page 15))
  - **What BIM purpose is required?** The BIM purpose is energy and lighting performance analysis, focusing on daylight.We will use BIM to simulate the building design based on energy efficiency and daylight.
 We will analyze material choices (glazing) by integrating U-Value calculations with daylight simulations.
 And by using python to research our assignment
  - **BPMN drawing:**

  <summary>A2e. Tool Idea</summary>

 ### Group 14
  - **Describe idea of your OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool**  The idea behind our  OpenBIM ifcOpenShell Tool is to provide an open-source solution for working with  IFC in the BIM environment. It allows users to create, modify, and analyze IFC files without being tied to proprietary software. Our tool is designed to help professionals  by ensuring that BIM data can be shared and used across different platforms.
  - **Business and Societal value:** Business Value: Cost savings, interoperability, process automation, and regulatory compliance.
 Societal Value: Promotes sustainability, knowledge sharing, and increases accessibility to BIM  tools for smaller firms and educational institutions.

  - **Summarizing BPMN diagram:**

  <summary>A2f. Information requirements</summary>
 
  ### Group 14
 - **Identification of required information from model** To calculate the U-value of a window, you need to know the thermal conductivity of the materials (glass, frame, and gas between panes), the number of glass layers (single, double, or triple glazing), the thickness of the glass and gaps between panes, and the type of gas used in the cavity (e.g., air, argon).
 Additionally, the presence of Low-E coatings, the material of the window frame (wood, aluminum, PVC),
 and the type of spacer bars (e.g., aluminum or warm-edge) also affect the U-value.
